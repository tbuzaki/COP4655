POC Final

How to use the code:

1) Download all 4 files: index, Search, Results, and search.js.
2) Create a Cordova Project.
3) Replace the contents of the 'www' folder with the 4 files. Make sure all 4 are in the SAME folder; do not put search.js into a js folder. 
4) Run the Cordova project on an emulator or android device.
