Hello,

My name is Thomas Buzaki. This is my Works Portfolio.
It contains different works I have completed during
my studies. The folders contain the working code
for an Android APP that is used to track stocks. 
The "Other Assignments" file contains links to 
various other assignments I have completed, including
several web pages and video demos.

I hope you find my works interesting. Should you wish
to contact me, I can be reached VIA email at:
Tbuzaki@gmail.com
or by phone at:
954-319-4665
I live in the eastern time zone.
